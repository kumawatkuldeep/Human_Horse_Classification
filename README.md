# Human_Horse_Classification

In this repository we are classifying between human and horse and make a prediction.

We have 1027 training data and 256 validation data of humans and horses.

We'll be also implementing callbacks in this which will help us to stop training once it reached desired accuracy.

I've already added the dataset in the repository for ease, but if you want to take a look on dataset in the web the visit https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/horses-or-humans-dataset
